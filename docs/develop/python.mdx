Welcome to the Resonate Python SDK guide!
This SDK makes it possible to write Distributed Async Await applications with Python.
This guide covers installation and features that the SDK offers.

➡️ [Resonate Python SDK API reference](https://resonatehq.github.io/resonate-sdk-py/)

## Installation

**How to install the Resonate Python SDK into your project.**

To install the Resonate Python SDK, you can use any of your favorite package managers.

**Rye**

```shell
rye add resonate-sdk
```

**Pip**

```shell
pip install resonate-sdk
```

Then initialize the SDK in your project, register your top-level function(s) and call the `.run()` method:

```python
# Import the Resonate SDK
from resonate.stores.local import LocalStore, MemoryStorage
from resonate.resonate import Resonate

# ...

# Create a Resonate instance with a local store
resonate = Resonate(store=LocalStore(MemoryStorage()))

# Define and register your function
@resonate.register
def your_function(ctx, args):
    # ...
    return

# Invoke the function using the run method
your_function.run("your_promise_id", args)
```

## Promise storage modes

The Resonate Python SDK supports two storage modes: Local and Remote.

### Local storage

**How to use Local storage mode in the Resonate Python SDK.**

[Local storage mode](/concepts/durable-promise#local-storage) is ideal for starting out with Resonate.

```python
from resonate.stores.local import LocalStore, MemoryStorage
from resonate.resonate import Resonate

# ...

# Create a Resonate instance with a local store
resonate = Resonate(store=LocalStore(MemoryStorage()))
```

### Remote storage

**How to use Remote storage mode in the Resonate Python SDK.**

Remote storage ensures promises are stored in the Resonate Server.
To enable Remote storage, pass the Resonate Server's address when initializing Resonate:

```python
from resonate.task_sources.poller import Poller
from resonate.stores.remote import RemoteStore
from resonate.resonate import Resonate

# ...

# Initialize the Resonate using the Resonate Server as remote storage
resonate = Resonate(
    store=RemoteStore(url="http://localhost:8001"),
    task_source=Poller(url="http://localhost:8002"),
)
```

## Function registration

**How to register a function with Resonate in the Python SDK.**

There are two ways to register a function with Resonate: using the `register` method or using the `@resonate.register` decorator.

**Decorator**

```python
from resonate.stores.local import LocalStore, MemoryStorage
from resonate.resonate import Resonate
from resonate.context import Context

# ...

# Create a Resonate instance with a local store or remote store
resonate = Resonate(store=LocalStore(MemoryStorage()))

# Define your function
# Use the register decorator to register a function
@resonate.register
def your_function(ctx, args):
    # ...
    return

# Invoke the function using the run method
your_function.run("your_promise_id", args)
```

**Method**

```python
from resonate.stores.local import LocalStore, MemoryStorage
from resonate.resonate import Resonate

# ...

# Create a Resonate instance with a local store or remote store
resonate = Resonate(store=LocalStore(MemoryStorage()))

# Define your function
def your_function(ctx, args):
    # ...
    return

# Register the function with Resonate using the register method
resonate.register(your_function)

# Invoke the function using the run method
resonate.run("your_promise_id", your_function, args)
```

## Set a Retry Policy

**How to set a Retry Policy in the Resonate Python SDK.**

:::warning Older version

The following documentation reflects version 0.2.4 of the Resonate Python SDK.

:::

You can set a Retry Policy to control how a function should be retried if it fails.
A Retry Policy can be set at the function level or when the individual function is invoked.

There are several different [built in Retry Policies available](/concepts/failure-detection-and-recovery#retry-policies), and each one can be refined to your needs.

### Function registration

Here is an example of setting an Exponential Retry Policy when registering a function:

```python
from resonate.retry_policy import Exponential

// ...

resonate.register(your_func, retry_policy=Exponential())
```

### Function invocation

Here is an example of setting a Constant Retry Policy when invoking a function:

```python
from resonate.retry_policy import Constant

// ...

ctx.lfc(another_func, retry_policy=Constant())
```

## Dependency injection

**How to use Dependency injection in the Resonate Python SDK.**

You can inject dependencies into your Resonate instance and use them in functions that receive the Resonate Context.

```python
from resonate.stores.local import LocalStore, MemoryStorage
from resonate.resonate import Resonate
from resonate.context import Context

# ...

# Create a Resonate instance with a local or remote store
resonate = Resonate(store=LocalStore(MemoryStorage()))

# ...
resonate.set_dependency("dependency-a", dependency())
resonate.set_dependency"dependency-b", "some-dependency")
```

Then you can access the dependencies in your functions:

```python
def yourFunc(ctx: Context):
# ...
dep = ctx.get_dependency("dependency-a")
```

## Sleep

**How to sleep inside a function with the Resonate Python SDK.**

Resonate's sleep is durable, meaning it will persist across restarts and failures.

```python
@resonate.register
def your_function(ctx, args):
    # ...
    ctx.sleep(5)
    # ...
```

The previous function will sleep for 5 seconds and then continue execution.

## Batch operations

**How to use batch operations in the Resonate Python SDK.**

:::warning Older version

The following documentation reflects version 0.2.4 of the Resonate Python SDK.

:::

Resonate's transparent batching feature handles the coordination of otherwise concurrent executions to create batches, enabling you to write concurrent, non-coordinated code.
For a deeper dive into transparent batching, check out the [Transparent batching with the Resonate Python SDK](https://blog.resonatehq.io/transparent-batching-with-the-resonate-python-sdk) blog post.
To use transparent batching, follow these steps.

First, create a data structure that inherits what Resonate calls a Command interface.
The data structure must include the data to be inserted into the database.
The Command data structure stands in for a function execution invocation so that you still get a Durable Promise and await on result.

```py
from dataclasses import dataclass
# ...
from resonate.commands import Command
# ...
# Define a data structure for the Resonate SDK to track and create batches of
@dataclass
class InsertUser(Command):
    id: int
```

Then, create a handler that can process a batch of operations.

```py
# ...
from resonate.context import Context
# ...
# Define a function that inserts a batch of rows into the database
# The main difference is that commit() is only called after all the Insert statements are executed
def _batch_handler(_: Context, users: list[InsertUser]):
    # error handling ommitted for this example
    for user in users:
        conn.execute("INSERT INTO users (value) VALUES (?)", (user.id,))
    conn.commit()
    print(f"{len(users)} users have been inserted to database.")
```

Next, register the data structure and the handler with the Resonate Scheduler.

```py
# ...
from resonate.scheduler import Scheduler
from resonate.storage import LocalPromiseStore
from resonate.retry_policy import never
# ...
# Create a Resonate Scheduler
resonate = Scheduler(LocalPromiseStore(), processor_threads=1)
# ...
# Register the batch handler and data structure with the Resonate Scheduler
resonate.register_command_handler(InsertUser, _batch_handler, retry_policy=never())
```

Finally, create a function that can be invoked over and over again and passes the data to Resonate to manage.
Register it with the Resonate Scheduler, and then call that function with Resonate's `run()` method.

```py
# ...
# Definte the top level function that uses batching
def create_user_batching(ctx: Context, u: int):
    p = yield ctx.lfi(InsertUser(u))
    yield p
# ...
# Register the top level functions with the Resonate Scheduler
resonate.register(create_user_batching, retry_policy=never())
# ...
def main() -> None:
# ...
    # Create an array to hold the promises
    promises = []

    for u in range(10000):
        p = resonate.run(f"insert-value-{u}", create_user_batching, u)
        promises.append(p)

    for p in promises:
        p.result()
```
